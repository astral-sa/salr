   <li>Added functionality to allow third-party websites to easily
       confirm your SA Forums account identity. When a third-party website
       requests to confirm your SA identity, a confirmation window pops up
       allowing you to
       accept or deny the authentication request; and your SA Forum
       profile is automatically edited to include the verification code
       the third-party website requested if you accept. For a sample of
       the process visit <a href="http://static.evercrest.com/www/images2/ext/sa/salrConfirmTest.html">here</a>.</li>

       thread page, spacebar will take you to the next thread page. When you're
       on the last page of the thread, spacebar causes the page to reload.</li>

   <li>Made parse changes to account for changes in the forum template.</li>

 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.815</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Added a failsafe to Quick Reply. If the extension detects that the
       forum rejected your Quick Reply as a forged post, it will insert a link
       on the forged alert page to open the text of your otherwise lost reply
       in a regular forum reply page.</li>
   <li>The Quick Reply window will cache your forum anti-forged post key
       during a browsing session when you first Quick Reply, so that future
       Quick Replies are faster.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.806</div>

   <li>General performance improvements.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.798</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Added an update notifier icon that will appear in the lower right corner of the browser when
       on the forums and an extension update has been detected for this browser session. The icon will
       show a green globe with an upward pointing arrow when a non-crucial update is available, and
       will show a red globe with an X when a critical update is required (and the current version has
       been killed). Clicking the icon will take you to the extension's forum thread to download the update.</li>
   <li>Removed configuration option to quote images as links, and made it
       non-optional behavior. Images will always Quick Quote as links now,
       just like the forum does with regular, non-quick replies.</li>
   <li>Added a temporary fix for Quick Quote when quoting posts that have a
       text-to-image converted image to prevent unparsed HTML from showing up
       in the Quick Quote window.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.780</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Fixed post highlighting to use the Post ID in addition to the
       post's date/time. This will prevent any unread posts from being
       colored blue just because they were posted in the same minute as
       the last post you actually read. (This was most often noticed
       when going to a new page in a thread.)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.775</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Changed Quick Reply window to pop up faster. The "Submit" button
       on the window will be grayed out while it retrieves your
       formkey forum security value in the background.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.772</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>The extension will no longer show error messages if it fails to
       check the kill switch for any reason.</li>
   <li>Split the emoticon dropdown menu in the Quick Quote window into
       subgroups by the first letter of the emoticon.</li>
   <li>Fixed thumbnailed resizing of text-to-image converted images.</li>
   <li>Added an image attach button to the Quick Reply window. Users with
       platinum accounts can use this button to attach images to their
       posts.</li>
   <li>Made the emoticon button much more :cool:.</li>

       Firefox.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.718</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Added an option to disable text-to-image if the containing post
       contains an NWS warning (if it contains "nws",
       "work safe", or "safe for work"; case-insensitive). This may not
       catch all NWS images; so rely on this at your own risk!</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.716</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Fixed a problem where the "#" post link would only show up if you
       had text-to-image enabled.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.715</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Fixed text-to-image support to work better for some images, including
       those where the source link was shortened with "..." by the forums.</li>
   <li>Text-to-image inserted images are no longer part of the link they
       were created from, which should make clicking them to resize them
       from shrunken to fullsize easier, since it won't pop open the
       image in a new page anymore. They also only scale
       proportionally down based on a max
       width now, rather than both width and height. (Quoted thumbnailed
       images still scale to a max width and height.)</li>
   <li>Added a direct link to each post (a "#" link added to the right of
       the date/time attached to every post).  This can be turned off in
       the preferences dialog.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.703</div>
  <ul class="notes">
   <li>Added the ability for a release of the extension to be 'killed',
       in the event that a critical bug is found, or if changes to the forums
       necessitate an upgrade. A message will be shown when you start
       Firefox if you need to upgrade.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with the fallback Quick Quote functionality where
       &lt; would be quoted as &amp;lt;, etc.</li>
   <li>In the <i>extremely unlikely event</i> that someone were to post a link
       to a torrent on a website that downloaded the torrent file from a
       script named download.php that takes an info_hash parameter, the link
       to it will no longer open in a new window. Perhaps if people ever start
       posting torrents on the forums, this feature will be useful in preventing
       unwanted blank popup windows.</li>
   <li>The extension will no longer text-to-image links to image URLs that
       contain '?', '&lt;&lt;', or '&gt;&gt;'.</li>

   <li>Fixed the issue where the
       link's clickable area would be much larger than it should be
       for a text-to-image converted image.</li>
   <li>Added a change where text-to-image converted images will be
       constrained to a maximum width of 600 pixels, then be clickable
       to expand out to the full size (much like quoted thumbnailed
       images work). This behavior can be turned off in the configuration

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.585</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Added link-to-image functionality. The extension will only convert
       links to URLs ending in gif, jpg, jpeg, or png (case-insensitive). It
       will also handle qstats image links for Fight Club. It
       will not autoconvert URLs to images that are <b>not</b> links in order

 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.548</div>

   <li>Fixed a bug where closing the SpellBound spell checker window
       in the Quick Reply window by using the X in the upper right
       corner of the window would wipe out the contents of the reply.</li>
   <li>Added keyboard shortcuts to the Quick Reply window:
     <ul>
      <li><b>Alt+S</b>: Submit the post</li>
      <li><b>Alt+P</b>: Preview the post</li>

  <ul>
   <li>Added the new Leper's Colony to the forum Quick Jump menu.</li>
   <li>Added a new page to the configuration dialog with version
       information and credits.  Also, how long you've spent on the
       forums (since installing this version).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.456</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Another stab at hiding other SA menus. This time it works.</li>
   <li>You can now add seperator lines to the pinned forum list. Click the
       "Add Sep" button in the pinned forum editor to add a seperator
       line.</li>
   <li>Saving colors in the preferences dialog works now.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.442</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension will now hide any other SA menus installed by other
       extensions. You can disable this behavior from the configuration
       dialog.</li>
   <li>The [PL=...] BBCode tag will now be parsed when you edit a post.</li>
   <li>The extension is now compatible with version 0.6 of the
       <a href="http://www.exchangecode.com/spellbound/index.html">SpellBound</a>
       spell-checking extension. This <b>may</b> have broken compatibility
       with older versions of SpellBound -- if so, you should upgrade
       SpellBound.</li>
   <li>Made the configuration dialog resizable when opened from the
       "Configure Last Read Extension" link on each forum page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.434</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Added a configuration option to toggle the SA Grenade background
       on the Quick Jump menu on or off.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem where the extension would mistakenly think it was
       in forum 26 when it's not, which would cause thread post highlighting
       to fail.</li>
   <li>The extension will now warn you if you try to navigate away from a
       page that has a Quick Reply window open, and offers you the
       opportunity to cancel the navigation to keep the Quick Reply
       window open.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem where sometimes where quoting with the the Quick
       Reply window would come up with empty quoted text. This is due to
       the forum's post HTML being inconsistent. If the extension can't
       find the post text itself, it will ask the forum server for the
       post text, which may make the Quick Reply window take a couple
       seconds to appear. This doesn't apply to additional quotes added
       to an already open Quick Reply window, though.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.399</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Replaced the configuration page with a configuration dialog.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.218</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed the problem where the extension would fail to properly save
       its data files on non-Windows OSes if the file's default configured
       location was used.</li>
   <li>You can now "pin" your favorite forums to the bottom of the SA Forum
       Quick Jump menu if you have the menu set to group the forums into
       submenus by category. There is an option on the configuration page to
       change which forums are pinned. (A better UI for this option is
       coming in a future release.)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.154</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension now correctly honors the nested SA Forum Menu
       preference setting.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.153</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Overhauled the SA Forum Quick Jump menu with a code submission
       by <b>Pahalial</b>, bringing over some features from
       <b>CarryTheZero</b>'s forum menu extension. You can right-click a
       menu entry to open it in a new tab. There is also now an
       option to nest the forum menu by forum categories on the
       settings page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.135</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension will now highlight threads when you're viewing your
       subscribed thread list.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.12.118</div>
  <ul>

  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.117</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Added an install script for the full Mozilla suite. The extension
       should install on Mozilla now -- but it's unsupported, do so at your
       own risk.</li>
   <li>The Quick Reply window is now compatible with the SpellBound
       Firefox extension (spellbound.sourceforge.net)
       for spell checking. A "Spell Check" button will automatically
       appear in the Quick Reply window when the SpellBound extension is
       installed.</li>
   <li>The default settings for the "Subscribe" and "Show Signature" settings
       in the Quick Reply window are now configurable.  The "Show Signature"
       setting will only automatically add your signature to your first post
       in a thread if it is set to default to be checked.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.70</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The Quick Reply and Quick Quote buttons will no longer appear
       on closed threads.</li>
   <li>Hopefully fixed bugs where threads wouldn't properly be marked as
       "replied to" for the yellow highlight on the thread list.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.67</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Changed name of "Quick Quote" window to "Quick Reply". This makes
       sense for both quotes and replies, whereas "Quick Quote" only made
       sense for quotes.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.12.66</div>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.62</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Tighten up the thread handling code to remove some cases where
       certain types of threads would cause errors.</li>
   <li>Added Quick Multiquote override. If the Quick Quote window fails to
       appear when you click the button on a thread, try double-clicking the
       button, which will override the code used to try to place quotes from
       multiple posts in the same Quick Quote window.</li>
   <li>Added a configuration option for the storage location of the forum
       list XML data.</li>
   <li>Added Quick Reply button which works the same as the Quick Quote
       button.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.12.52</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Includes fix for Linux users from version 1.11.51.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.51</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed a problem where access denied errors would occur to users
       running under Linux. Settings files will now be saved in C:\ (Windows),
       or your home directory (Linux) if for any reason your Firefox profile
       directory can't be found.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.48</div>

       by the Quick Quote window now.</li>
   <li>A "SA" menu has been added to the browser window to provide a quick
       jump to any forum. This menu is automatically updated with every
       forum you have access to the first
       time you visit any forum thread in a Firefox session. The menu will
       not appear for the first time until you visit a forum thread. This
       menu can be turned off in the configuration page.</li>
   <li>Clicking the Quick Quote button on a post while the Quick Quote window
       is already open will add the quote from the selected post onto the
       end of the text in the Quick Quote window.</li>
   <li>Clicking the "Options" icon in the Extension Manager now works for
       changing the extension's options again.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.20</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension's version information has been updated to be
       compatible with Firefox versions 0.9 through 1.0.</li>
   <li>Replying to a thread through the Quick Quote window will now
       correctly mark threads as posted in.</li>
   <li>Usernames displayed to the left of posts will now have the CSS
       class "somethingawfulforum_username_<i>username</i>" applied to
       them, where <i>username</i> is the user's username with non-alphanumeric
       characters replaced with underscores.</li>
   <li>The location of the extension's thread data store can be changed
       through the configuration page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.9</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed a problem where the Quick Quote button would direct the
       browser to the normal reply page when certain other extensions
       are installed.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.1</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed a problem with Quick Quote text where the quoted user's
       username had non-alphanumeric characters replace with
       underscores.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.11.0</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Changed to the 'odd release numbers are development, even release
       numbers are stable' version numbering scheme.</li>
   <li>Added "Quick Quote" reply functionality, and a configuration
       toggle to turn it off. Clicking the arrow button next to the
       Quick Quote button will
       bring up the normal quote reply page.</li>
   <li>Added mouseover tooltip text for thread rating icons showing the
       average thread rating and number of votes.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.10</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The loading changes from version 1.04 have been removed.</li>
   <li>Made initialization considerably smarter -- the extension should no
       longer fail when opening new browser windows, and will no longer
       lose data if multiple instances of Firefox are started from the
       Firefox icon, rather than using New Window functions within an
       existing window.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">1.04 (Super Double-Secret Test Edition)</div>
  <ul>
   <li>New document load detection code that should make the extension
       perform all the page changes <b>without having to wait for all
       the images and stuff on the page</b>. This is highly experimental
       and may kill innocent puppies.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.03</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed the bug where an error window would appear when replying to
       a thread.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.02</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Detecting when you post in a thread now works properly if you've
       previewed the post first, and no longer marks the thread as posted in
       if you <b>only</b> preview a post.</li>
   <li>Added a Changelog window to the extension's About window, accessible
       through the Extension Manager. The Changelog window will show once
       automatically after a new update has been installed.</li>
   <li>Coloring for threads and posts now works in FYAD, and FYAD has some
       seperately configurable colors to use on the configuration page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.01</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The CSS class name being created was incorrect for users that had spaces and/or punctuation in their name. This has been fixed, and all spaces and punctuation now are correctly replaced with underscores.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="rel">1.0</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension will now reposition a thread page to the anchored post after all images have loaded. This behavior can be disabled from the configuration page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.26 (RC2)</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Clicking the options button in the Extension Manager will launch the configuration page in a new window.</li>
   <li>The CSS class "somethingawfulforum_postby_<i>username</i>" will be added to each post on a thread page, where <i>username</i> is the name of the user that made the specific post. The name is mangled a bit to be a safe CSS class name, any non-alphanumeric character in the name is replaced with an "_". You can use your profile's userContent.css to apply specific styling to a poster of your choice.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.25 (RC1)</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The extension will add the CSS class "somethingawfulforum" to the body of every page served up by the forums. It will additionally add a class named "somethingawfulforum_forumdisplay_php" to all pages by forumdisplay.php -- and other forum .phps will have the appropriate equivalent class added.</li>
   <li>The extension now works with Firefox's automatic updating system. You can now use the Update button in the Extension manager to check for/install updates, and if you have Firefox configured to automatically check for updates, it'll let you know when there are updates available.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.22</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Colors for seen and unseen posts within a thread are now seperately configurable from the colors used on the thread lists.</li>
   <li>The extension will now apply one of three CSS classes to thread rows on thread list pages. You can use this in conjunction with your Firefox profile's userContent.css file to apply any sort of extra formatting you want to apply to threads. The classes are "salastread_unreadthread", "salastread_readthread", and "salastread_readwithnewthread".</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.21</div>
  <ul>
   <li>No more errors when entering The Film Dump. The extension won't work in there, but at least it won't pop up an error window anymore.</li>
   <li>Added the color for replied thread highlighting to the configuration page.</li>
   <li>You can now choose on the configuration page to put the "go to last read post" icon on every visited thread, even if they don't have new posts. This is disabled by default, which makes it act like previous versions where it would only place that icon on threads with new posts.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.20</div>
  <ul>
   <li>When you reply to a thread, the extension will keep track of that and will highlight the number of replies column in yellow on the thread listing page. See the first post for a screenshot of this. This currently only works for replies, not for new threads, and not if you just edit a post.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.19</div>
  <ul>
   <li>The URL generated by the "Go to Last Read Post" icon has been fixed. This got broken in 0.16.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.18</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Preferences now load properly when you exit and restart Firefox. This accidentally got broken in 0.16.</li>
   <li>You can choose the order that you want the thread icons to display, from left to right.</li>
   <li>Clicking a "mark unvisited" icon no longer removes all the other icons from the page.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.16</div>
  <ul>
   <li>An icon has been added to mark a thread as unvisited, which makes the extension forget you've ever been in the thread, so it will no longer be colored in thread listings. See the first post in the thread for an image pointing out the icon. You can configure the image used for this icon on the preferences page. Thanks for <b>LonelyKing</b> for his implementation of this which the code is based off of.</li>
   <li>On the preferences page, you can disable either or both thread icons, to your liking.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.15</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Colors and icons are configurable. By using the "Configure Last Read Extension" link near the top of each forum page, you can change the colors used for thread highlighting, and you can change what image is used for the "Go to last read post" icon. See the first post in the thread for a screenshot of the link. You can also change these values through about:config (see preferences starting with "salastread."), but they won't take effect until you restart Firefox if you change them there.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.14</div>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Browsing in tabs now works properly!</b> Thanks to <b>protactin</b> for the push in the right direction to get this fixed. If you have any problems with tabs that aren't fixed now, let me know.</li>
   <li>Auto cleanup of salastread.xml is now implemented. The file is cleaned up automatically when Firefox starts. Any thread that you haven't seen a new post in within the past 7 days will be cleaned from the file. This feature relies on your system date being set properly, and may be off by 24 hours in either way depending on your time zone compared to the forums' time zone.</li>
   <li>New extension icon, thanks to <b>uncut product</b>, and new "go to new posts" icon, thanks to <b>8ender</b>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.13</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Recognizing posts you make to a thread works now. This time I mean it. It will also enable highlighting on a thread in situations where it wouldn't work previously. I don't know if this will fix the problems that were being blamed on the tabbrowser extension problems previously reported; probably not, but it's worth a shot.</li>
   <li>If you've visited a thread, and the thread has new posts, in addition to being green in the thread list, an icon will appear that will link directly to the last post that you saw in the thread. (I can't link to the first <b>new</b> post because I don't know what it's ID is, so I just link to the last <b>old</b> post.) See the new screenshot in the first post for an example. This will only work on threads you've read since you've installed 0.13, since earlier versions didn't store the last post ID in a thread.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.12</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Colors have been swapped around. On the thread listing page: threads you haven't viewed at all will be the regular forum colors, threads you've viewed but don't have any new posts will be blue, and threads you've viewed that have new posts will be green. On a thread page: posts you've seen will be blue, and posts you haven't seen yet will be the regular forum colors. See the new images in the first post for examples.</li>
   <li>It will now detect <b>your</b> new post when you've posted on a thread. The previous version wouldn't detect the new post because the URL you get redirected to after making the post didn't have the thread's ID number in it. Now, if I can't get it off the URL, I get it off the "Subscribe to this Thread" link at the bottom of the page. (This may not currently be working all that well, since it just failed for me on this very post -- I'll give it some more TLC).</li>
   <li>I fixed the 0.9.1+ maxversion value. I'm also doing all my development on 0.9.1 now because I got fed up with 0.9 corruping my user profile. <tt>:(</tt></li>
   <li>It adds a "Configure Last Read Extension" to the bunch of links at the top of each forum page, but it doesn't really do anything useful yet. I'm working on that for the next release.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><div class="dev">0.1</div>
  <ul>
   <li>Initial Release</li>
